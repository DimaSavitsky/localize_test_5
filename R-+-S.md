## From JSON to AMP

In the most common scenario, a Progressive Web App is a single page application that connects to a JSON API via Ajax. This JSON API then returns sets of data to drive the navigation, and the actual content to render the articles.

You would then proceed and convert the raw content into usable HTML and render it on the client. This process is costly and often hard to maintain. Instead, you can reuse your already existing AMP Pages as a content source. Best of all, AMP makes it trivial to do so in just a few lines of code.
